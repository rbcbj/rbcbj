## Hey there! 👋

I am a Software Engineer with experience in building systems and have spent my career moving between backend development, frontend interfaces, and platform engineering. In summary: basically, looking forward to wherever the interesting technical challenges are.

I'm very interested in building tools that make other developers' lives easier, implementing observability solutions and automating away the tedious stuff so teams can focus on shipping features. I'm all about pragmatic solutions that improve the developer experience.

I love understanding how things work, learning new approaches and customizing solutions. I'm passionate about delivering improvements while also keeping focus on software architecture and engineering best practices.
